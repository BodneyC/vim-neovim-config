# Vim and Neovim Configuration Files

Pretty much what it says on the tin, these are my configuration files for Vim and Neovim; feel free to use them or copy from them or whatever you please.

## Branches

- [master](https://github.com/BodneyC/vim-neovim-config/tree/master) is the original configuration with CoC as an LSP client (or, well, VSCode plugin client...)
- [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/BodneyC/vim-neovim-config/tree/nvim-lsp) has a working (but old at this point) configuration with the in-built LSP
- [everything lua](https://github.com/BodneyC/vim-neovim-config/tree/everything-lua) has the entire config, with nvim-lsp, tree sitter, ftplugin, etc all in LUA
